            <h2>What exactly is "Endless"?</h2>
            <p class="text-hist">Endless is a visual album by American singer Frank Ocean.

                It was released on August 19, 2016, as an exclusive streaming-only video on Apple Music, and preceded the August 20 release of Ocean's second studio album Blonde.
                
                Endless was later remastered and had a limited reissue in physical audio and visual formats on April 10, 2018.
                
                The album followed a period of controversy for Ocean, who was in a highly publicized battle with Def Jam Recordings, and it was the subject of widespread media discussion upon release.
                
                Endless was recorded in various studios across California, as well as in London, Miami, and Berlin, with production handled primarily by Ocean, Vegyn, Michael Uzowuru, and Troy Noka</p>

            <p class="text-hist">The film follows Ocean silently woodworking on a staircase while the audio plays.

                Music journalists have noted the album features a minimalist aesthetic with a loose musical structure and contains similar elements featured on Blonde, including ambient pop, avant-soul, R&B, and trap.
                
                <br>Thematically, Endless explores Ocean's status as a celebrity, love and heartbreak, and age.
                
                It also contains uncredited guest appearances from Sampha and Jazmine Sullivan.

            <h2>Rollout and Reception</h2>
            <div>
                <p>On August 1, 2016, a video appeared that showed Frank Ocean woodworking and sporadically playing instrumentals on loop. That same day, many news outlets reported that August 5, 2016, could be the release date for his next album 'Boys Don't Cry'</p>
                <p>The video was revealed to be promotion for Endless, a 45-minute-long visual album that began streaming on Apple Music on August 19, 2016.</p>
                <p>It was later confirmed that Endless is a different project than Ocean's second studio album. The assumed title 'Boys Don't Cry' had been replaced with a new title. </p>
                <p>Endless was his final album with Def Jam Recordings, which fulfilled his recording contract.</p>
                <p>Endless received generally positive reception, with critics praising the musical content, namely its abstract structural compositions, although some were divided over the visual aspects, noting its length.
                 <br> Upon its re-release, it was positively reassessed, with praise directed toward its variety and since then became a cult favorite among Frank Ocean fans.</p>
